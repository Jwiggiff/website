intro: I am currently looking for a 12-month full-time internship position starting in September 2024 as part of my school's internship program, after which I will return to school for my last year of studies. I am someone who loves to learn, and I am looking for a position that supports that goal, but where I can also contribute my existing experiences and knowledge to the team. I am always looking to stay at the forefront of new technologies, adapting my process to be more efficient by using tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for debugging. I am particularly passionate about projects that bridge the gap between hardware and software, such as robotics or programming physical systems!

  There's more to me besides engineering! I have a passion for music, playing guitar and saxophone, as well as listening to R&B, Rock and Roll, Jazz and Pop music.

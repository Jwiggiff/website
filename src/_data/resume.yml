  There's more to me besides engineering! I have a passion for music, both listening and performing. I am currently part of a pit band for a musical and I ran a charity concert called Covid Creations that raised over $14,000 for Sunnybrook Hospital's Covid Research Fund! I also enjoy martial arts and currently hold my 3rd degree black belt in Karate.

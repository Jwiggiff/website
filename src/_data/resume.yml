  I have over <b>5 years</b> of <b>JavaScript</b> experience from <b>NodeJS</b> backends to vanilla JS on websites. I started teaching myself <b>React</b> about <b>1 year</b> ago and have been using it consistently in personal projects as well as websites I have created for others. I have <b>4+ years</b> of <b>HTML/CSS</b> experience. In fact, I made this resume with just that! I started getting into mobile development <b>2 years</b> ago using <b>Flutter</b> and have used it for personal projects and in past work experience. I have been using <b>Java</b> for <b>3 years</b> and <b>C</b> for <b>2 years</b> in coursework. I have used <b>Firebase</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> backends, and have <b>2 years</b> of <b>Git</b> experience in teams and individual projects. I have played with <b>Linux</b> quite a bit in my free time and even have a home server running cloud storage and a media server.

  There's more to me besides engineering! I have a passion for music, both listening and performing. I am currently part of a pit band for a musical and I ran a charity concert called Covid Creations that raised over $14,000 for Sunnybrook Hospital's Covid Research Fund! I also enjoy martial arts and currently hold my 3rd degree black belt in Karate.
